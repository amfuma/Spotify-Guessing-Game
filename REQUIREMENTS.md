## Requirements Overview

A business would like your team to build a music-themed guessing game. The logic for this guessing game is completely up to your team, however your game must include the following:

- A configuration page that allows players to update the game's settings. Once a player adjusts the game with their desired configurations, these settings should persist across multiple local game instances.

- Guessing logic while playing the game, whether that be multiple choice, matching, text input, etc.

- Audio samples from each of the various songs/albums that will be displayed while playing the game. These samples should be able to be played and paused.

- A game over/win/loss screen that displays a player's final score and allows players to enter their name.

- A leaderboard that displays the names of top scoring players across multiple local game instances. At a minimun, this page should be accessible from the configuration page.
